What is Shell Scripting?
•	A shell script is a text file that contains a series of commands written for the Unix/Linux shell (command-line interpreter like bash, sh, zsh).
•	Instead of typing commands one by one in the terminal, you put them inside a script file and run it as a program.

Why use Shell Scripting?
•	To automate repetitive tasks (like backups, monitoring, file management).
•	To combine multiple Linux commands into one program.
•	To create custom utilities.

Example
Normally, if you run these commands manually:
mkdir testdir
cd testdir
touch file1.txt file2.txt
ls -l
Instead, you can put them in a script myscript.sh:
#!/bin/bash
mkdir testdir
cd testdir
touch file1.txt file2.txt
ls -l
Run it once → and it does everything automatically 

Shell scripting = Writing Linux commands in a file, giving it logic (like variables, loops, conditions), and automating tasks.

Task Management in Linux
Configuring Cron Jobs
In Oracle Linux, cron is a time-based job scheduler used to automate repetitive tasks such as backups, system updates, monitoring scripts, and more.

1. What is cron?
The cron daemon (crond) runs in the background and executes scheduled tasks, known as cron jobs, based on time and date settings defined in a special file called the crontab.

2. Basic Format of a Cron Job
Each line in the crontab follows this format:

3. Viewing and Editing Crontab
To view or edit the current user's cron jobs:
crontab -e
To view the crontab:
crontab -l
To remove the crontab:
crontab -r

4. Example Cron Jobs
Backup every day at 2 AM:
0 2 * * * /home/oracle/scripts/backup.sh
Run a script every 5 minutes:
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/check_status.sh
Restart Apache every Sunday at midnight:
0 0 * * 0 systemctl restart httpd

5. System-Wide Cron Jobs
•	Stored in: /etc/crontab
•	Also: /etc/cron.d/, /etc/cron.daily/, /etc/cron.hourly/
Example from /etc/crontab:
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
30 3 * * * root /usr/bin/yum update -y
This runs a system update as root every day at 3:30 AM.



What is cron?
•	Cron is a job scheduler in Unix/Linux systems.
•	It lets you run scripts or commands automatically at specific times/dates.
•	Example: You can schedule a backup every night at 2 AM.

Where is it configured?
Jobs are listed in a crontab (cron table) file.
To edit your crontab:
crontab -e
To list your scheduled jobs:
crontab -l
Crontab Format
The syntax has 5 time fields + command:
*  *  *  *  *  command_to_run
│  │  │  │  │
│  │  │  │  └── Day of week (0-6, Sunday=0)
│  │  │  └───── Month (1-12)
│  │  └──────── Day of month (1-31)
│  └─────────── Hour (0-23)
└────────────── Minute (0-59)

Examples
1.	Run script every minute:
* * * * * /home/user/myscript.sh
2.	Run at 2:30 AM daily:
30 2 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
3.	Run at 5 PM every Friday:
0 17 * * 5 /home/user/report.sh
4.	Run every 10 minutes:
*/10 * * * * /home/user/check.sh
Always test your script first manually:
./myscript.sh
Then put it in crontab.
<<<bash shell>>>>
Advantages: 
	We can access our OS more effectively and efficiently
	Makes it lot easier and fun to work at OS level
	Automation
	Run sequence commands in a single command
	Easy to use and maintain
	Quick start 
	Interactive debugging

Disadvantages:
	Prone to costly errors
	Design flaws within the syntax

=============================================
Basic commands::
1. pwd: present working directory
2. ls: list the files in the directory
	in linux, if the file starts with '.',then it is hidden
	if we want to see hidden files as well, 'ls -a'
	if we want to see detailed descriptions of files present >> 'ls -al' or 'll'
 
	drwxrwxr-x 2(link counts) ubuntu ubuntu  4096 Apr 21 06:15[last modified time] scripting 

3. mkdir: make directory >> usage: mkdir directory-name
4. cd: change directory
	to come back to previous directory: 'cd ..'
5. rmdir: remove the directory
6. touch: create a empty file >>> usage: touch filename
7. rm: remove the file

8. echo: print/displays the output in terminal
9. cat: shows the content of the file
10. df : datafiles/file systems mounted
11. hostname : displays hostname of the machine
11. I want to change my hostname: hostnamectl set-hostname scripting-machine
12. sudo: gives user a permission to act like root user
13. if I am a sudo user and I want to become root user: sudo su[su - switch user]


In linux terminals, to write inside a file, there are two main editors: 1. vim editor, 2. nano editor

<<<<<Vim editor>>>>>

vim editor : it is a text editor for teminal

To create a file if not present or open an existing one: >>> 'vi filename'  or  'vim filename'

view the file: >>> view filename

Two modes of vi editor:

1. Insert mode >>> used to insert the text in the file
	>>> to go inside INSERT mode, press Esc key and type 'i'
2. command mode >>> used to execute vi editor commands in the vi editor
	>>> to go into command mode, press Esc key and type ':'

How to get out of the vi editor: >>>
	Go into command mode [Press Esc] and type ':q'
	To override the changes and quit without writing(saving) the changes, use ':q!'

How to save(write) in the file:
	Go into the command mode after making changes in the file
	Press Esc key, type ':wq'

To verify, do 'cat filename' and display the content of the file in terminal

Dive little bit deep in vi editor:

Create a new file with command >>> 'vi  insert-options'

After pressing Esc key, there are other options in insert mode::
Inserting the text>>>>>
'i' : Insert the text at the current cursor location
'I' : Insert the text at the beginning of current line
'a' : Insert the text after the current cursor location
'A' : Insert the text at the end of the current line
'o' : Create a new line for entering the text below the cursor location
'O' : Create a new line for entering the text above the cursor location

Moving in vi editor>>>>
'k' : move up 
'j' : move down
'h' : move left
'l' : move right

Deleting the text>>>>>
'x' : Delete the text after the cursor
'X' : Delete the text before the cursor
'dw' : Delete the word from current cursor location to the next word
'd^' : Delete till the start of the line from current cursor location
'dd' : Delete the entire line on which the cursor is present

Searching the text>>>>
To search, press Esc key and then press either '/' or '?' and start typing the pattern we are searching for.
Searched pattern will get highlighted, then if you press Enter, the cursor will go where the pattern is found.
Then we can go into INSERT mode by pressing Esc and then 'i' and start inserting

To search a word which is occurring multiple times, just search as above and after pressing Enter, press 'n' to move to the
next occurance of the word.

=======================================================================================================

To create a bash script, it should have an extension which is '.sh'.
for example: my-script.sh

Requirements to execute a script:
	shell
	absolute path of the script
	arguments (if any)

To execute the bash script, there are two ways to do this::
1) 'bash my-script.sh'
		[suppose we are not in the directory where our script is present, then we will give entire path]
		'bash /home/ubuntu/scripting/my-script.sh'
		
	'bash my-script.sh' >>>> bash is shell that we are using
						>>>> my-script.sh is the script we are executing

2) './my-script.sh'
	To execute the script with above command, we have to make our script executable.
	We should give execution permissions.

"Location of bash shell is '/bin/bash'"

Script is a file which contains commands which wil get executed one by one [sequentilly]

To make the script executable, we will use 'chmod'
command>>>> chmod +x first-script.sh    [change the permissions]

[[[[[

rwx as permissions:: symbolic mode
But there is different way to give permissions
numeric mode>>>>
rwx			rwx			rwx
421			420		400
7			6			4
chmod 777 first-script.sh

0	000	- - - 	No Permissions
1	001		- - x	Only Execute
2	010		- w -	Only Write
3	011		- w x	Write and Execute
4	100		r - -	Only Read
5	101		r - x	Read and Execute
6	110 	r w -	Read and Write
7	111		r w x 	Read, write and execute

]]]]]]


Example 1::
Create a script with 'vi script-name.sh'
Inside the script, add 3-4 echo commands and don't forget to add '#!/bin/bash'
save the script
Execute it with bash script-name.sh
Then give executable permissions 'chmod +x script-name.sh' and try ./script-name.sh

===============================================
Example 2:
Adding comments in our bash script>>>
Single line comments : #This is a comment
Multi-line comments : : ' This is also a comment
						This is not a normal comment,
						This is a multi-line comment
						'
================================================
Example 3:
Variables in Bash>>>
	The variables don't have a data type. 
	a = "something"
	b = 7
	To use or call these variables, we use 'doller sign ($)'
	$a >>>> "something"

Two types of variables in bash>>>
1. user defined variables : Variables defined by user. [mostly written in small letters(not compulsory)]
2. System defined variables : Variables defined by the SYSTEM
	What are these system defined variables??
		BASH, BASH_VERSION, HOME, OSTYPE, PWD, USER
	To call these variables: 
		echo $BASH
		echo $BASH_VERSION
		echo $HOME
		echo $OSTYPE
		echo $PWD
		echo $USER

	>> If you want to check what are all the variables present in our system, use commands 'printenv' or 'env'

#!/bin/bash
test="Automation is very fantastic"
secondtest="This is second variable"
echo $test
echo $secondtest
#SYSTEM defined variables
echo $BASH
echo $BASH_VERSION
echo $HOME
echo $OSTYPE
echo $PWD
echo $USER

=======================================================
#!/bin/bash
name="Maddy"
like="The Batman"

echo "Hi there!! I am $name and I like $like"


>>> chmod +x variable-1.sh
>>> ./variable-1.sh
=============================

[mv old-filename new-filename.sh]     >>>>>    Renaming the file

=============================

We want to get the variable values from user>>>

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hey, What is your name?"
read name
echo "Please tell me what do you like?"
read like
echo "Thank you $name and we are glad that you like $like"

========================================================
Conditions in bash>>>>
1) if statement>>
[	if (this is this)
		then 
			do this
		else
			do that
]

syntax for bash:
	if [condition];
		then
			task
		else
			other task
	fi
if statement example:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Tell us the number in your mind."
read number
if [[ $number -gt 50 ]]		#if [$number > 50]
	then
		echo "Great!! Your number is greater than 50."
	else
		echo "Sorry!! Your number is less that 50."
fi

Bash 'if' operators for numbers:
-eq : equal to
-ne : not equal to
-lt : less than
-gt : greater than
-le : less than or equal to
-ge : greater than or equal to

=====================================

There's defined variable called UID(User identifier):
Always, in linux, root user has UID equal to 0.

#!/bin/bash
if [[ $UID -eq 0 ]]
then
echo "You are a root user!!"
else
echo "You are not a root user!!"
fi
 


[there is a file called sudoers, in which we will add our user to which we want to provide root privilages]



===============================================

if statement with AND logic:
if [condition1 && condition2]
	then
		do this
	else
		do this
fi

Example of username and password>>>>

#!/bin/bash
echo "Please enter your username"
read username
echo "Please enter your password"
read password
if [[ ( $username == "maddy" && $password == "scripting" ) ]]		#it will work with one '=' as well
then
echo "Congrats!! You are authorised."
else
echo "Sorry, you can't go ahead."
fi

==========================================

if statement with OR logic:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number"
read number
if [[ ( $number -eq 50 || $number -eq 100 )]]
then
echo "You won :)"
else
echo "You lost :("
fi

Bash 'if' operators for string >>>
'==' or '=' : equal to
!= : not equal to
-z string : checks if the string is empty
-n string : checks if the string is not empty

=============================================

else if statement>>

if [condition]
	then
		do this
else if [condition2]
	then 
		do this
else
	do that

In case of bash, below is the syntax >>>>
if [[ condition ]]
then
	task
elif [[ another condition ]]
then 
	some other task
else
	do something else
fi

Example for elif statement >>>

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter the 200s scored by Rohit:"
read score
if [[ $score -eq 264 ]]
then
echo "Perfect, that's the highest score in ODI"
elif [[ $score -eq 219 ]]
then
echo "You are right!! One more double hundread!!"
elif [[ $score -eq 209 ]]
then
echo "That's three double hundreads in ODIs"
else
echo "This score is not scored by Rohit"
fi

==================================================
case statement in Bash >>>>
case [expression]
	expression = what we have given
		do this task
	expression = other expression
		do that task

case syntax in Bash >>>

case expression in
option1)
do the task ;;
option2)
do the task ;;
option3)
do the task ;;
*)
do the other task ;;
esac

Example for case statement in bash >>>>>

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter the marks you scored:"
read marks
case $marks in
300)
echo "Congrats!! You recieved first prize." ;;
200)
echo "You recieved second prize." ;;
100)
echo "You came in third place." ;;
*)
echo "Try harder next time." ;;
esac

======================================================

Loops in scripting >>>

for (start; end; increment) {
	perform our task as mentioned in for condition
}

for loop in bash :

for (( counter = 0; counter >n; counter++ ))
do
	tasks
done

example of for loop:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter till what number you want the number printed"
read number
for (( counter=1; counter < $number+1; counter++ ))
do
echo $counter
done

=====================================================

while loop in bash >>>>
syntax for while loop in bash:
while [condition]
do
	[tasks]
done

example for while loop in bash>>>
#!/bin/bash
echo "Give me a number less than 10"
read number
while [ $number -le 10 ]
do
echo $number
(( number++ ))
done

Functions in Bash>>
Basic syntax:
1)>>
function_name () {		#defining the function
	we will write our function(commands) here
}

function_name		#calling the function


2)>>
function function_name {

}


Simple function example>>
#!/bin/bash
simple_function () {
	echo "This is a simple function."
}

function another_function {
	echo "This is an another function."
}

simple_function
another_function

=========================================

Basic Shell Scripting Concepts 
1. Variables
In shell scripting, variables store values like text, numbers, or paths.
#!/bin/bash
# variables.sh

NAME="Maddy"
FOLDER="/mnt/c/Users/user/test"

echo "Hello $NAME, your folder is $FOLDER"
 Real-world use: Store paths, filenames, or usernames so you don’t repeat them everywhere.
Example: backup scripts often use a variable for the source and destination folder.

2. Conditionals (if-else)
Used to check conditions (like file exists, user input, etc.).
#!/bin/bash
# check_backup.sh

BACKUP="/mnt/c/Users/user/backup"

if [ -d "$BACKUP" ]; then
    echo "Backup folder exists: $BACKUP"
else
    echo "Backup folder not found. Creating now..."
    mkdir -p $BACKUP
fi
Real-world use: Ensure directories exist before saving backups, check if a service is running, or verify a file is present before processing.

3. Loops
(a) For loop
Repeat commands for a list of items.
#!/bin/bash
# loop_files.sh

for FILE in /mnt/c/Users/user/test/*.sh
do
    echo "Found script: $FILE"
done
 Real-world use: Scan through log files, batch process files, or loop over multiple servers.

(b) While loop
Run until a condition is false.
#!/bin/bash
# countdown.sh

COUNT=5
while [ $COUNT -gt 0 ]
do
    echo "Shutting down in $COUNT seconds..."
    sleep 1
    COUNT=$((COUNT - 1))
done
 Real-world use: Retry a failed operation, monitor a service, or create a countdown before shutdown.

4. Case Statement
Good for menus or multiple options.
#!/bin/bash
# menu.sh

echo "Choose an option:"
echo "1. Show date"
echo "2. List files"
echo "3. Show current user"

read -p "Enter choice: " CHOICE

case $CHOICE in
    1) date ;;
    2) ls -l ;;
    3) whoami ;;
    *) echo "Invalid choice" ;;
esac
Real-world use: Create menu-driven scripts for automation tasks, like system maintenance or developer toolkits.

5. Functions
Group reusable code.
#!/bin/bash
# functions.sh

backup_folder() {
    SRC="/mnt/c/Users/user/test"
    DEST="/mnt/c/Users/user/backup"
    DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

    mkdir -p $DEST
    tar -czf $DEST/test_backup_$DATE.tar.gz $SRC
    echo "Backup done: $DEST/test_backup_$DATE.tar.gz"
}

backup_folder
